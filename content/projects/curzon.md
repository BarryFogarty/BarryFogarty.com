<p>
My client, <a href="https://www.darewest.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dare West</a>, was engaged by Curzon to build a highly engaging listing site for their cinema and on-demand streaming services, and a CMS capable of wrangling huge amounts of data in a flexible and intuitive way.   They were particularly concerned with delivering an intuitive system for their content editors to keep the website updated.  I was brought on to the project with this in mind - to improve and extend the way the content was managed in the CMS.  I was also responsible for front-end coding on the site, and building an API client so customers could watch films on Curzon's streaming service on their device of choice.
